INTRODUCTION 
The Energy Regulation Act No. 12 of 2019 mandates the Energy Regulation Board (ERB) to promote the development and use of new 
and appropriate technologies in the energy sector. 
In line with the said mandate the ERB is cognizant of the continuous change in petroleum fuels technology worldwide. These changes 
are partly driven by the environmental drivers and the impact petroleum fuels in vehicles have on the atmosphere and climate change. In 
this light, a number of petroleum stakeholders have proposed the use of Additives in petroleum fuels (unleaded petrol and diesel) in 
Zambia. The ERB, through a consultative process with various stakeholders, which included members of the Petroleum Products 
Quality Standards Technical Committee (PPQSTC), Additives have been identified as one of the measures that play a role in the 
performance of vehicle engines with regards to their durability, power, fuel consumption and emissions. However, Additives need to be 
properly tested to ensure that they function as expected in vehicles and that they do not cause any unintended consequences. Therefore, 
there is need to develop criteria for approval of Additives to be used in petroleum fuels.

Zambia Gazette 
11th April, 2025 
This paper proposes the criteria for the approval of Additives for use in the petroleum subsector in Zambia. 
OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of the criteria are to: 
* 
To define the criteria to be followed before an Additive can be added into a petroleum fuel by the OMCs in the country’s main 
fuel supply chain. 
* 
To define additive test parameters, test methods and equipment required to carry out tests. 
* 
To define a criterion that can be used in developing a quality standard for Additives. 
BENEFITS OF ADDITIVES 
Energy conservation 
Fuel additives have been in use for many years and have shown their ability to perform in the internal combustion engine, optimising 
the efficiency, especially in modern engines, where the tolerances are very small. This has allowed for significant improvements in specific 
fuel consumption of vehicles, while ensuring long service life. 
Fuel economy 
Fuel additives can have an impact of fuct economy, essentially through keeping the fuel system clean, it can operate at the design 
efficiency and hence minimise the deterioration over time. Very high levels of cleanliness are required for modern high performance 
(efficiency) engines, making the role of Additives more important. It has also been found that a dirty engine results in increased exhaust 
emissions, which has a negative impact on the environment. 
Enhanced safety 
Reduced risk of static discharge when handling the product. 
Reduced maintenance 
Protection of fuel tanks and other equipment from corrosion, protection of fuel system equipment in engines from wear and stability 
improvement to prolong storage life. 
Performance enhancement 
Fuel saving from optimised vehicle performance and economy. 
Environmental control 
Emissions reduction from fuel system cleanliness and combustion optimisation. 
SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES 
The scope of the guidelines shall cover approval criteria of multifunctional Additives which are typically used downstream of the 
refinery and are combined into a package that provides performance-enhancement for the petroleum fuels (including biofuels/blended 
fuels) in vehicles. These shall include but not limited to the following: 
¢ 
Deposit control additive (DCA), 
¢ 
Demulsifier, 
* 
Corrosion inhibitor, 
* 
Cetane Improver, 
° 
Anti-Foam, 
¢ 
Cold flow improver, 
« 
Octane enhancers, 
* 
Lubricity improvers, and 
* 
Stability improvers. 
Note: There is no approved list or industry body that approves the use of Additives. ZEMA does however require that Additives are 
‘registered’ but the Agency does not test candidate products for engine efficiency, emissions benefits, or safety as part of the registration 
process. The chemical composition is merely registered by the Additive company. Registration does not represent the Agency’s endorsement 
of the product.",424,2864,

fuel economy and performance. These engines 
are much more sophisticated than indirect 
injection types, and must retain all their 
calibration precision in order to maintain their 
designed performance. The injectors are 
vulnerable to having their operation impaired 
by fouling from the deposits resulting from 
combustion. Hence a new test procedure has 
been developed that can demonstrate the 
potential of fuels to cause fuel injector fouling 
in these modern engines.New injectors are 
bedded-in for 16 cycles on the non-fouling DF79 
fuel, test fuel is then flushed through the engine 
and the test is run for 8 cycles before stopping 
for 4 hours. This is repeated 3 times and test 
finishes after a further 8 cycles. The percentage 
power loss at Stage 12 over the 32 cycles is the 
final result of this test. The test can discriminate 
between fuels that differ in their ability to 
produce injector deposits. The target is to be 
able to discriminate between a fuel that produces 
no measurable deposits and one which produces 
deposits that cause the 2% loss in power

ADDITIVES PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
Additives have been used for a long time and a number of them have been extensively tested in industry accepted tests. This ensures 
that the Additives: 
' 
1. 
function as expected, 
2. 
can differentiate the performance of one from the other, 
3. 
cause no harm, and 
4. 
do not negatively impact any other aspects of fuel propertics or performance. 
Evaluating their effectiveness is costly and extremely complex. Careful consideration should be given to legislation that may be 
considered in this regard. Experience from other markets has shown treat rates may reduce to the point of providing less than optimal 
performance due to the difficulties in implementing a regulatory, as opposed to a market driven, process. 
As aminimum the following should be considered: 
* 
Standardised Engine Test Methods - Based On Real-World Conditions 
* 
Standardised Laboratory Test Methods - Based On Real-World Conditions 
* 
The Setting of Effective Limits - Based On Engine Tests Developed Using Sound Statistical Science with Appropriate Test 
Reference Fuels 
* 
Approved Verified Accredited Test Laboratories should be used 
* 
16 point material safety data sheet (MSDS) should be evaluated by ZEMA to ensure that the product is safe to handle. 
DOSING OF ADDITIVES 
The accurate dosing of additives is critical for several reasons, including: 
() 
Cost, 
(ii) 
Consistency of dosing, 
(iit) 
Ensuring that overdosing does not occur, 
- (iv) 
Ensuring homogeneous mixtures, and 
(v) 
<Auditability. 
Dosing of Additives shall be accurately done into the pipelines or fuel depots in line with best industry practice. 
Typically, a MonoBlock metering and contro] manifold shall be used that has variable injection rates, depending on the flow rate. This 
option presents audit trail.

        "# 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING\n",
        "## 1.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
        "\n",
        "The Zambia Government Gazette publishes official notices, legal updates, tenders, and public announcements. These documents are published in PDF format, and often unstructured, making it difficult for stakeholders such as lawyers, journalists, researchers, and the general public to quickly find relevant information. Manual searching is time-consuming and prone to oversight. There is a need for an automated method to classify Gazette notices into categories (e.g., legal notices, tenders, appointments, public warnings) for faster retrieval and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.2 BUSINESS OBJECTIVES\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective is to develop a system that automatically processes and classifies Gazette publications into predefined categories. Success will mean that end users can:\n",
        "\n",
        "Quickly identify and filter notices by category.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduce time spent manually scanning through documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gain improved access to relevant legal or public information.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a real-world perspective, this will increase efficiency for professionals and citizens who rely on the Gazette for important updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.3 DATA MINING GOALS\n",
        "\n",
        "We will build a text classification model that:\n",
        "\n",
        "Extracts text from Gazette PDFs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preprocesses the text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).\n",
        "\n",
        "Classifies each notice into categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outputs labeled data for easy search and retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "The approach will likely involve Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.4 INITIAL SUCCESS CRITERIA\n",
        "\n",
        "The project will be considered successful if:\n",
        "\n",
        "The classification model achieves at least 80% accuracy on the test dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Categories are clearly and vividly defined, distinct, and interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline can handle at least 10 new Gazette PDFs per month without major manual intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Users confirm that classification results improve search speed and relevance compared to manual reading.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.5 SCOPE & ASSUMPTIONS\n",
        "\n",
        "Scope:\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus on classifying Gazette notices into 4â€“6 main categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Work only with English-language Gazettes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Process and analyze a subset of recent Gazette issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "PDF files are accessible and legally permissible for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Categories remain consistent over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "OCR (Optical Character Recognition) will be needed for scanned documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.6 RISKS & CONSTRAINTS\n",
        "\n",
        "Risks:\n",
        "\n",
        "Poor text quality from scanned PDFs may reduce OCR accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notices may belong to multiple categories, complicating classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limited labelled training data could impact model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "Legal constraint: Must comply with any copyright or government data use regulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.7 Expected Benefits\n",
        "The system will enable faster retrieval of Gazette notices, enhance transparency, and support informed decision-making for both professionals and the public.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. METHODOLOGY\n",
        "## 2.1 DATA COLLECTION\n",
        "\n",
        "Download Gazette PDFs from the official Zambia Government Gazette website.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensure documents cover a representative period to include diverse categories.\n",

These changes \\nare partly driven by the environmental drivers and the impact petroleum fuels in vehicles have on the atmosphere and climate change. In \\nthis light, a number of petroleum stakeholders have proposed the use of Additives in petroleum fuels (unleaded petrol and diesel) in \\nZambia. The ERB, through a consultative process with various stakeholders, which included members of the Petroleum Products \\nQuality Standards Technical Committee (PPQSTC), Additives have been identified as one of the measures that play a role in the \\nperformance of vehicle engines with regards to their durability, power, fuel consumption and emissions. However, Additives need to be \\nproperly tested to ensure that they function as expected in vehicles and that they do not cause any unintended consequences. Therefore, \\nthere is need to develop criteria for approval of Additives to be used in petroleum fuels. \\n399\\n\\n400 \\nZambia Gazette \\n11th April, 2025 \\nThis paper proposes the criteria for the approval of Additives for use in the petroleum subsector in Zambia. \\nOBJECTIVES \\nThe objectives of the criteria are to: \\n* \\nTo define the criteria to be followed before an Additive can be added into a petroleum fuel by the OMCs in the country\\u2019s main \\nfuel supply chain. \\n* \\nTo define additive test parameters, test methods and equipment required to carry out tests. \\n* \\nTo define a criterion that can be used in developing a quality standard for Additives. \\nBENEFITS OF ADDITIVES \\nEnergy conservation \\nFuel additives have been in use for many years and have shown their ability to perform in the internal combustion engine, optimising \\nthe efficiency, especially in modern engines, where the tolerances are very small. This has allowed for significant improvements in specific \\nfuel consumption of vehicles, while ensuring long service life. \\nFuel economy \\nFuel additives can have an impact of fuct economy, essentially through keeping the fuel system clean, it can operate at the design \\nefficiency and hence minimise the deterioration over time. Very high levels of cleanliness are required for modern high performance \\n(efficiency) engines, making the role of Additives more important. It has also been found that a dirty engine results in increased exhaust \\nemissions, which has a negative impact on the environment. \\nEnhanced safety \\nReduced risk of static discharge when handling the product. \\nReduced maintenance \\nProtection of fuel tanks and other equipment from corrosion, protection of fuel system equipment in engines from wear and stability \\nimprovement to prolong storage life. \\nPerformance enhancement \\nFuel saving from optimised vehicle performance and economy. \\nEnvironmental control \\nEmissions reduction from fuel system cleanliness and combustion optimisation. \\nSCOPE OF THE GUIDELINES \\nThe scope of the guidelines shall cover approval criteria of multifunctional Additives which are typically used downstream of the \\nrefinery and are combined into a package that provides performance-enhancement for the petroleum fuels (including biofuels/blended \\nfuels) in vehicles. These shall include but not limited to the following: \\n\\u00a2 \\nDeposit control additive (DCA), \\n\\u00a2 \\nDemulsifier, \\n* \\nCorrosion inhibitor, \\n* \\nCetane Improver, \\n\\u00b0 \\nAnti-Foam, \\n\\u00a2 \\nCold flow improver, \\n\\u00ab \\nOctane enhancers, \\n* \\nLubricity improvers, and \\n* \\nStability improvers. \\nNote: There is no approved list or industry body that approves the use of Additives. ZEMA does however require that Additives are \\n\\u2018registered\\u2019 but the Agency does not test candidate products for engine efficiency, emissions benefits, or safety as part of the registration \\nprocess. The chemical composition is merely registered by the Additive company. Registration does not represent the Agency\\u2019s endorsement \\nof the product.\\n\\n11th April, 2025 \\nZambia Gazette \\n401 \\nTEST METHODS AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT \\nTesting and Standardisation Organisations \\nThere are essentially two internationally accepted Testin g and Standards bodies which are ASTM and CEC.

This ensures \\nthat the Additives: \\n' \\n1. \\nfunction as expected, \\n2. \\ncan differentiate the performance of one from the other, \\n3. \\ncause no harm, and \\n4. \\ndo not negatively impact any other aspects of fuel propertics or performance. \\nEvaluating their effectiveness is costly and extremely complex. Careful consideration should be given to legislation that may be \\nconsidered in this regard. Experience from other markets has shown treat rates may reduce to the point of providing less than optimal \\nperformance due to the difficulties in implementing a regulatory, as opposed to a market driven, process. \\nAs aminimum the following should be considered: \\n* \\nStandardised Engine Test Methods - Based On Real-World Conditions \\n* \\nStandardised Laboratory Test Methods - Based On Real-World Conditions \\n* \\nThe Setting of Effective Limits - Based On Engine Tests Developed Using Sound Statistical Science with Appropriate Test \\nReference Fuels \\n* \\nApproved Verified Accredited Test Laboratories should be used \\n* \\n16 point material safety data sheet (MSDS) should be evaluated by ZEMA to ensure that the product is safe to handle. \\nDOSING OF ADDITIVES \\nThe accurate dosing of additives is critical for several reasons, including: \\n() \\nCost, \\n(ii) \\nConsistency of dosing, \\n(iit) \\nEnsuring that overdosing does not occur, \\n- (iv) \\nEnsuring homogeneous mixtures, and \\n(v) \\n<Auditability. \\nDosing of Additives shall be accurately done into the pipelines or fuel depots in line with best industry practice. \\nTypically, a MonoBlock metering and contro] manifold shall be used that has variable injection rates, depending on the flow rate. This \\noption presents audit trail. \\nPROPOSED GUIDELINE FOR ACCEPTANCE OF ADDITIVES \\nAny Additives that are to be considered for use in petroleum fuels shall meet the following aspects and shall be documented: \\nRequired Documentation \\n(3) 16-point material safety data sheet (MSDS) that shall include but not limited to the following: \\n(a) \\nThe effect on emissions, \\n(2) \\nThe effect on the operation and durability of engines, fuel and exhaust systems and pollution control systems, \\n(c) \\nThe effect on the environment, \\n. \\n(@) \\nThe effect on human health and safety, \\n(e) \\nThe effect on the interests of consumers, and \\n(f Shelf life (stability), \\n(ii) \\nAny relevant scientific advice and research on the Additive or class of Additives, \\n(iii) The effect that the additive will have on the properties of foel specification including long term storage stability, \\n(iv) Any international regulations or international standards conceming the Additive or class of Additives, \\n(v) \\nCosts, \\n(vi) Additive manufacturer\\u2019s recommended dosing methodology. \\n(vii) Industry standard testing, including:\\n\\n404 \\nUnleaded petrol: \\n(a \\n(b) \\n(\\u00a2) \\n(@) \\n(e) \\n* \\nDiesel: \\n(a) \\n(2) \\nCopper corrosion, \\nZambia Gazette \\n11th April, 2025 \\nElastomer testing full specification testing (SANS 1598 / EN228) \\u2014 comparing it to the base petrol, \\nImpact or water shedding, \\n\\u2018Wet corrosion, and \\nEmission testing (rolling road). \\nCommon rail, \\nHERR, \\n(a) \\nFull specification testing (SANS 342 / EN590) \\u2014 comparing it to the base diesel, \\n(b) \\nImpact or water shedding, \\n(c) \\nWet corrosion, and \\n(2) \\nEmission testing (Bench \\n/ rolling road), \\n(viii) Documented field testing with controls, \\n(ix) \\nREACH registered & Bacterial testing, if contains a fungicide, and \\n(x) \\nAll additives should be provided with sufficient industry approved testing. \\nProposed test limits \\nData for the following tests should be supplied in representative fuel. \\nUnleaded petrol (Including ethano) blends) \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTest \\nHours \\nProposed test limits \\nRequired \\nInlet Valve Cleanliness | \\nEvaluate the propensity of petrol or petrol additive \\n60 \\n<20 mg / valve \\nin the MB M102E \\nformulations to prevent intake valve deposits in fuel \\nEngine (CEC F-05-A- | \\ninjected engines.
